# D-o-n-t-Look (Deny-obfuscate-never-trolled-look)

**D-o-n-t-Look** helps you develop habits for avoiding advertisements in everyday life by applying algorithmic behavior patterns. In a world where ads are everywhere, this script guides you to consciously block out distractions and make more mindful choices, both online and offline.

### Key Features
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Teaches you to recognize and avoid ads using principles from digital ad-blocking algorithms.
- **Decision-Making**: Encourages critical thinking to challenge the influence of advertising in your daily life.
- **Real-World Application**: A simple way to apply ad-blocking strategies to your offline experiences.

### Why Use D-o-n-t-Look?
Advertisements are all around usâ€”on billboards, in stores, on TV, and online. **D-o-n-t-Look** helps you develop a mindset to block out these distractions, allowing you to focus on what matters to you. By applying algorithmic thinking, the script encourages you to consciously filter out ads and reclaim your attention.

### How It Works
- The script guides you through a series of prompts, encouraging you to apply the same decision-making patterns that digital ad blockers use.
- It helps you build awareness about how ads influence your choices, and teaches you how to avoid them without effort.
